first_JSONP_project (The Movie Spot)
====================================

This project was my first introduction to doing an AJAX request.

The project gets a movie title string from the user, then submits 
an AJAX request to api.themoviedb.org, which returns JSON which 
is then stored in a Javascript object.

The Javascript object is then mapped to populate stylized html elements 
on the page for the movie returned. 

Initially the idea was to return multiple movies, but given the level 
I was at (at the time of the project) and some possible issues with 
nested callbacks with this API, the project was revised to just return
one movie. By comparing this earlier code (needs quite a bit of refactoring)
to my later projects, you can see how my style has improved.
